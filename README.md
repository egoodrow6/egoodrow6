## 👩‍💻 About Me
I'm a current Junior studying Computer Science at Notre Dame with a mission to **leverage tech for impact**. My journey started with **Girls Who Code**, where I discovered my love for programming and community. Since then, I’ve been growing through programs like **Institute for Social Concerns Summer Fellowship**, **Machine Learning and Network Biology Research**, and **The Grace Hopper Celebration**.

When I'm not coding, I'm involved in student orgs like **TutorND**, **Ryan Hall Sports**, and **The Learning Resource Center** on campus.

Fun facts: I am an active member of the Notre Dame Ballet Club, a flag football Interhall Champion, and I love baking with my Priest in Residence every Tuesday!
